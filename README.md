# Day-1
First day with c

2025 10 03: After a lot of frustration I worked out how to execute my code. I had to do the following:
  Create the correct environment for development.
    Install the C/C++ microsoft extension - Already in place
    Install mingw64 for compiling my code
    Install the code running extension to translate the extension - I think this is what it does anyway. 
  I still had some issues with the PATH, however if I ran .\temptable.c in the terminal in runs - This is because the .\ makes the system look directly at the current folder. 
  Also after changes I need to create a new executable to get a different terminal output.
